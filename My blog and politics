-  👋 Hi, I’m @PAKISTANECN1
- 👀 I’m interested in  - Разработки приложений , открытый исходный код , Integration and merging of platforms into a single dependent chain "Build bridges" :) To study and try to change something for the better, so to speak, to contribute. Web3 . 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...I learn everything at once, I can't take one thing and finish. I study the construction of the code, how the application is written and how the code is rebuilt from any impact on the application. I would like to write my own code construction without breaking the chain.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I would like to understand the signing of contracts and pulling tokens, I need help with that.
